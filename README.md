# -HR-Analytics-Dashboard
I am thrilled to showcase my latest project‚Äîan HR Analytics Dashboard! üöÄ Transformed raw HR data into a dynamic, interactive tool packed with actionable insights. üñ•Ô∏è

Key Steps in the Project:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation and Cleaning:

Addressed missing values and resolved inconsistencies within the dataset.

Standardized data fields such as salary ranges and job roles to simplify analysis.

Ensured data accuracy to maintain the reliability of insights.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration and Analysis:

Conducted a detailed analysis to derive metrics like attrition rates, average salaries, and average tenure.

Discovered patterns and trends related to employee job satisfaction level, and employee attrition based on education, age,  and Department wise.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Dashboard Development:

Utilized Power BI to create an interactive and visually engaging dashboard.

Included slicers for filtering insights at the departmental level.

Highlighted key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends to support HR decision-making.



Here are some insights based on the HR Analytics Dashboard:

Overall Summary:

Total Employees: 1,470

Attrition: 237 employees, resulting in an Attrition Rate of 16.12%.

Active Employees: 1,233

Average Age: 37 years

Department-Wise Attrition:

The R&D department has the highest attrition count with 133 employees (56.12%).

The Sales department follows with 92 employees (38.81%).

The HR department shows the least attrition with 12 employees (5.06%).

Age Group and Gender Analysis:

The 25‚Äì34 age group has the highest number of employees (554 total: 337 females, 217 males).

The 35‚Äì44 age group is the second-largest with 328 employees.

Females are slightly more represented in younger age groups (e.g., under 25 and 25‚Äì34).

Education Field-Wise Attrition:

The Life Sciences field shows the highest attrition (89 employees).

Other fields like Medical (35) and Marketing (33) also experience notable attrition.

The HR and Technical domains show lower attrition counts.

Job Role Insights:

The highest attrition occurs among Laboratory Technicians (259 employees), followed by Sales Executives (326 employees).

Job satisfaction ratings are relatively distributed, with most employees rating 3 or 4.

Gender Distribution by Age Groups:

In the Under 25 age group, attrition is nearly equal between genders (20 females vs. 18 males).

In the 35‚Äì44 age group, the majority of attrition is among males (72.55%).

Key Observations:

High attrition in the R&D department and among Laboratory Technicians indicates specific areas needing attention.

Employees in the 25‚Äì34 age group are the most likely to leave, signaling potential concerns like career progression or salary competitiveness.

Life Sciences professionals are more likely to leave than other fields, suggesting targeted retention strategies might be needed.

I Would like your further insights or recommendations based on this data.
